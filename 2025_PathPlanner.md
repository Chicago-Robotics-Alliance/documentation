# How to use the autos generated by PathPlanner!
This is documentation to use the paths preset in the codebase.

---
## What are the paths?
1. Drive Forward 0.5 m
2. Wait for a custom number of seconds then drive forward for 0.5 m
3. Nothing!

Paths 1 and 2 should get you the autonomous points for leaving the starting zone.

---
## How can you use them?
You have to change nothing in the code if you are planning on using one of those paths above.

1. Deploy Robot Code
2. Open Shuffleboard
3. Find the widget ```Auto Chooser```
4. Select the ```Drive Forward Auto```, ```Wait Drive Auto```, ```None```.
5. If you want to wait then move forward: enter a number in the widget ```Wait Time```. This number signifies the time that the robot will wait in __seconds__ before moving forward. The default is set to be 5 seconds.

## How can you change them?
Most of this can be done on [PathPlanner](https://pathplanner.dev/gui-getting-started.html). On PathPlanner, make sure you have opened the directory of the forked repo.

To change anything about driving forward: click on the drive forward path.

- To increase/decrease the legnth of the drive: click on end point and subtract as many meters to the x position you want to increase the drive by or add as many meters to the x position you want to decrease the drive by.
- To increase the speed of the drive: click on global constraints and increase/decrease your max velocity and/or your max acceleration.
