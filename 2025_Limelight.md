# Limelight 101
Make sure that you have a Limelight 3, robot with a PDP/PDH & Radio, an ethernet cable, two 18-20AWG wires, USB-A to USB-C cable, and one 5A/10A fuse. The [limelight documentation](https://docs.limelightvision.io/docs/docs-limelight/getting-started/limelight-3) is a great resource.

## Setup
1. Make sure that your robot has a well charged battery and turn it off.
2. Connect the two wires from your PDP to the Limelight and connect the ethernet from the Limelight to the Robot Radio.
3. Turn on the robot: you should see the green light blink once and stay solid.
4. Try connecting to the robot and going to ```limelight.local:5801```
5. Once you are able to, see the version on the top right corner. Check if it is the [latest version](https://docs.limelightvision.io/docs/resources/downloads). If not install the image for the latest version and BalenaEtcher. Follow the [instructions](https://docs.limelightvision.io/docs/docs-limelight/getting-started/limelight-3) labelled ```4. Updating LimelightOS```
6. Follow along the same [instructions](https://docs.limelightvision.io/docs/docs-limelight/getting-started/limelight-3) for the rest of the setup.
